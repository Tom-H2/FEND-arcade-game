#This project represents the work of Thomas Harris as part of the Udacity/Grow with Google FEND course

##I would not have been able to complete this project without the dedicated help of my Udacity mentor Arvind Rathee.

>Also I based my classes.js file on the FEND tutorial posted on the Slack channel #Project_3 GMT20180621-010258_FEND-Arcad_1600x900.mp4

#Instructions on how to Run and Play the Arcade Game:
  >To run the game:
    1) Load the index.html file in the browser
    2) The game board should appear with bugs moving across the rock bands and the player waiting in the center of the bottom most grass bands
    3) The object of the game is to move the player from the safe grass bands, across the dangerous rock bands, and into the water for a win
    4) At this point the game is ready for play

  >To play the game:
    1) Move the player up, down, left, and/or right using the arrow keys on the keyboard
    2) If a lady bug hits the player, the player is reset to the starting position
    3) If the player moves into the water you have won the Game
    4) Upon winning a modal appears that congratulates the winner and asks if you would like to play again
