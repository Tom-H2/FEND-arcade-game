This project represents the work of Thomas Harris as part of the Udacity/Grow with Google FEND course

I would not have been able to complete this project without the dedicated help of my Udacity mentor Arvind Rathee.

Also I based my classes.js file on the FEND tutorial posted on the Slack channel #Project_3 GMT20180621-010258_FEND-Arcad_1600x900.mp4

Instructions on how to Run and Play the Arcade Game:
  To run the game:
    1) Load the index.html file in the browser
    2) The game board should appear with bugs moving across the rock bands and the player waiting in the center of the bottom most grass bands
    3) The object of the game is to move the player from the safe grass bands, across the dangerous rock bands, and into the water for a win
    4) At this point the game is ready for play

  To play the game:
    1) Move the player up, down, left, and/or right using the arrow keys on the keyboard
    2) If a lady bug hits the player, the player is reset to the starting position
    3) If the player moves into the water you have won the Game
    4) Upon winning a modal appears that congratulates the winner and asks if you would like to play again

===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).
